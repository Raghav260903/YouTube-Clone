This project is a replica of the YouTube website's user interface, built using HTML and CSS. It aims to recreate the basic layout and visual elements of YouTube, showcasing your understanding of these fundamental web development technologies. I replicated the YouTube layout with a header, navigation bar, video thumbnails, and a search bar (functionality not included). I used CSS to style the elements and achieve a look similar to YouTube.
